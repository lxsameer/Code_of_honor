# Life

* Don't betray your code of honor.
* Defend your bushido way.
* Live life as a Man.
* Don't talk without a knowledge behind it.
* Don't argue with the crazy guy
* Justic
* Feel the pain of people.
* Always put your self in people's shoe before making any decision
* A simple smile goes a long way
