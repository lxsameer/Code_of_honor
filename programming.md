* Simplicity over Complexity
* Abstraction, Abstraction, Abstraction
* Put your conventions layer on top of a well written abstraction
* Always choose a name for your variables which implies the variable content or usage.
* Never ever use variable names such as `x`, `a`, `b`, etc.
* Bugs before new features
* Docs before new features
